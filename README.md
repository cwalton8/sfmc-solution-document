# Salesforce Marketing Cloud Solution Document

The purpose of this document is to provide a high-level framework for getting started with documenting how to provide a single customer view and associated data integration in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

Work on this document was largely inspired by a community support collaboration where Salesforce Marketing Cloud Developer Group assisted Autism CRC to setup their Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Supporting documentation for the Autism CRC project is available on request.
